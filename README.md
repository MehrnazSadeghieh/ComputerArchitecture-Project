# ComputerArchitecture-Project

This repository contains three MIPS assembly programs that demonstrate various computational tasks. Below, we provide a brief description of each program:

## 1. Insertion Sort Program (insertion_sort.asm)

The `insertion_sort.asm` program implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The algorithm iterates through the array, shifting elements as needed to insert each element into its proper place.

**Usage:**
1. The program expects an array of integers in memory.
2. Execute the program to sort the array in ascending order.
3. The sorted array will be stored back in memory.

## 2. Logarithm Calculator (log.asm)

The `log.asm` program calculates the logarithm of a given natural number 'x' in base 2.

**Usage:**
1. Provide the value of 'x' in memory.
2. Execute the program to calculate the logarithm of 'x' in base 2.
3. The result will be stored in memory and can be displayed as the output.

## 3. Fibonacci Sequence (fibonacci.asm)

The `fibonacci.asm` program defines the Fibonacci sequence recursively. It reads an input 'n' from memory, calculates the 'n'th term of the Fibonacci sequence, and stores the result in memory.

**Usage:**
1. Place the value of 'n' in memory.
2. Execute the program to compute the 'n'th term of the Fibonacci sequence.
3. The result is stored in memory.

These MIPS assembly programs demonstrate basic computational tasks and can serve as educational examples for computer architecture and assembly language programming.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the programs as needed.
